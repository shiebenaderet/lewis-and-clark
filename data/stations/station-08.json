      "By August 1805, the expedition’s success hinged on acquiring horses to cross the formidable Rocky Mountains. The Lemhi Shoshone possessed these horses, and Sacagawea’s identity as a Shoshone woman was now the expedition’s most valuable diplomatic asset.",
      "The reunion on August 17 produced one of the expedition’s most dramatic coincidences: Chief Cameahwait proved to be Sacagawea’s brother. The captains named the site Camp Fortunate, recognizing that this personal connection likely secured the horses and guides essential for the mountain crossing. Without this stroke of fortune, the expedition might well have failed.",
      "Lewis’s ethnographic observations of the Shoshone reveal the complex lens through which he viewed Indigenous peoples — simultaneously admiring their character while framing their material condition through Euro-American standards of wealth and civilization."

Yet Lewis simultaneously characterizes the Shoshone as living in “a wretched state of poverty.” Analyze the tension between Lewis’s admiration for Shoshone character and his judgment of their material condition. What cultural assumptions underlie his definition of “poverty”? How might the Shoshone have assessed their own circumstances differently?",
