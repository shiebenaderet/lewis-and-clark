At Lemhi Pass on the Continental Divide, the Corps crossed out of the Louisiana Purchase — the territory the United States had legal claim to — and into the disputed Oregon Country, claimed by both the U.S. and Britain.",
      "The 11-day mountain crossing (September 11–22) brought the expedition to the brink of starvation. Deep snow, fallen timber, and treacherous mountain paths killed several horses. The men resorted to eating horsemeat and candles made of animal tallow. Clark, who scouted ahead, reached a Nez Perce village and secured food that likely saved the party.",
      "The Nez Perce (Nimiipuu) not only provided food but taught the Corps to construct dugout canoes using controlled fire — a technique far more efficient than European methods. From here, the expedition launched onto the Clearwater River, then the Snake, and finally the Columbia, racing westward toward the Pacific with the current for the first time in the journey."

How do the Nez Perce’s actions — feeding the starving explorers and teaching them canoe-building — complicate the narrative of American self-reliance?",
