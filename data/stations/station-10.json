      "What followed was a remarkable democratic exercise. Lewis and Clark assembled the entire Corps to vote on their winter campsite location. Significantly, every member’s vote was recorded equally, including York’s (Clark’s enslaved companion) and Sacagawea’s. This occurred decades before the abolition of slavery and over a century before women or Native Americans gained suffrage. The vote reflects the pragmatic egalitarianism that extreme conditions can produce — a temporary suspension of the social hierarchies that would reassert themselves upon the expedition’s return.",
      "The winter at Fort Clatsop was miserable. It rained all but twelve of the 106 days they spent there. The journals shift from grand descriptions to grim accounts of rotting elk meat, pervasive fleas, and the tedium of waiting for spring. On March 23, 1806, they departed for the long journey home."
