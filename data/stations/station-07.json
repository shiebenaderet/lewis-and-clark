      "The Corps reaches the Great Falls of the Missouri River, confirming they are on the correct branch. What follows is one of the expedition’s most grueling ordeals: an 18-mile overland portage around the series of five cascades that took nearly a month to complete (June 16 to July 15). The men constructed crude wagons from cottonwood rounds to haul the heavy canoes and supplies.",
      "During the portage, the party endured extreme hardship: grizzly bear encounters, prickly pear cactus that shredded their moccasins, swarming mosquitoes, violent hailstorms, and temperatures exceeding 100°F. Lewis’s entry from the day he first sighted the falls stands in remarkable contrast to this suffering — it is among the most literary passages in the entire journal, revealing his struggle to capture sublime natural beauty in words."

    "reflection": "Lewis’s description of the Great Falls is often cited as an example of the “sublime” in early American nature writing — the Romantic-era concept that nature’s overwhelming grandeur inspires both awe and terror. Analyze Lewis’s literary techniques: his use of sensory details, metaphor, and scale. Note also the detail about “several Indian lodges” — even at this “undiscovered” wonder, there is evidence of prior human presence. What does this suggest?",
