He broke two rings of it into small pieces and mixed it with water for her. Whether this actually helped or not, I’m not sure, but she had the baby within 10 minutes of drinking it."

      "During the winter encampment at Fort Mandan, Lewis and Clark engaged the services of Toussaint Charbonneau, a French-Canadian fur trader living among the Hidatsa, and his young Lemhi Shoshone wife, Sacagawea. Charbonneau was hired nominally as an interpreter, but it was Sacagawea — approximately sixteen years old at the time — who would prove indispensable.",
      "Sacagawea had been captured by a Hidatsa raiding party around age twelve and subsequently acquired by Charbonneau. Her knowledge of Shoshone language and territory would prove critical when the expedition needed horses to cross the Rocky Mountains. Beyond her linguistic skills, her very presence — a young woman with an infant — signaled peaceful intentions to every nation they encountered.",
      "On February 11, 1805, Sacagawea gave birth to Jean Baptiste Charbonneau. Lewis’s journal entry on the birth reveals the blend of frontier folk medicine and Enlightenment skepticism that characterized his scientific observations throughout the journey."

Analyze this passage as a primary source: What does Lewis’s language reveal about Enlightenment-era attitudes toward scientific observation versus folk knowledge? How does Sacagawea’s story complicate the narrative of the expedition as a purely voluntary, heroic enterprise?",
