The fort took nearly four weeks to complete, with temperatures already plunging well below zero and over six inches of snow accumulating. This winter encampment proved crucial: it was here that the captains gathered extensive geographic intelligence from Hidatsa traders who knew the upper Missouri and the route to the Rocky Mountains."
