The Mandan and Hidatsa had maintained contact with European traders since the French explorer La Vérendrye arrived in 1738.",
      "Lewis and Clark begin constructing Fort Mandan, a triangular wooden fortification where the Corps will overwinter from November 1804 through April 1805. The fort took nearly four weeks to complete, with temperatures already plunging well below zero and over six inches of snow accumulating. This winter encampment proved crucial: it was here that the captains gathered extensive geographic intelligence from Hidatsa traders who knew the upper Missouri and the route to the Rocky Mountains."
