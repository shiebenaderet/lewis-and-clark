The expedition, commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, was tasked with finding a practical route to the Pacific Ocean, establishing diplomatic relations with Native American nations, and documenting the geography, flora, and fauna of the western territory.",

Three members are sons of French-Canadian fathers and Native American mothers, representing the existing mixed communities along the frontier. Clark brings York, a man he had enslaved since childhood, who would play a significant role throughout the journey. The rest include Army volunteers, skilled hunters, carpenters, and French boatmen (engagés).",
      "Their fleet consists of a 55-foot keelboat capable of carrying 12 tons of supplies and two smaller pirogues. Navigating upstream against the Missouri’s powerful current requires every technique available: sailing when wind permits, rowing, pushing with setting poles, and cordelling — wading along the bank and hauling the boats forward with tow ropes."
