      "The Corps of Discovery sets off from Camp Dubois (Camp Wood) outside St. Louis and begins its ascent of the Missouri River. The expedition, commissioned by President Thomas Jefferson following the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, was tasked with finding a practical route to the Pacific Ocean, establishing diplomatic relations with Native American nations, and documenting the geography, flora, and fauna of the western territory.",
      "Nearly four dozen men compose the initial party, drawn from diverse backgrounds reflecting the American frontier. Three members are sons of French-Canadian fathers and Native American mothers, representing the existing mixed communities along the frontier. Clark brings York, a man he had enslaved since childhood, who would play a significant role throughout the journey. The rest include Army volunteers, skilled hunters, carpenters, and French boatmen (engagés).",
      "Their fleet consists of a 55-foot keelboat capable of carrying 12 tons of supplies and two smaller pirogues. Navigating upstream against the Missouri’s powerful current requires every technique available: sailing when wind permits, rowing, pushing with setting poles, and cordelling — wading along the bank and hauling the boats forward with tow ropes."
