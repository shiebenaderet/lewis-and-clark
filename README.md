# The Lost Expedition — Retracing Lewis & Clark

An interactive, single-page website that turns 10 classroom stations on the Lewis & Clark expedition into an immersive Oregon Trail-inspired experience for students.

## Version

**v0.1.0** — Initial build

## What This Is

This project replaces a paper-based station activity (where students walk around the room reading printed primary sources) with a digital experience. Students play as a young historian retracing the Corps of Discovery's route, recovering "lost" journal entries at each stop along the trail.

**Target audience:** 8th grade social studies students

## Features

- **10 stations** with historical context and actual journal entries from Lewis & Clark
- **3 reading levels** togglable at any time:
  - *Easier Vocabulary* — 4th grade reading level, simplified text, vocabulary tooltips
  - *Standard* — 8th grade level (default)
  - *Advanced* — 10th grade level, deeper analysis, fewer scaffolds
- **Interactive trail map** (SVG) with progress tracking
- **Digital journal tracker** — replaces the paper handout (date, author, summary fields)
- **Random trail events** between stations (grizzly bears, storms, mosquitoes, etc.)
- **Reflection questions** at each station
- **Single HTML file** — no build step, no dependencies, works offline

## How to Use

Open `index.html` in any browser. That's it.

Works on Chromebooks, iPads, phones, and desktops. Can be hosted on any web server, shared via Google Classroom, or emailed as an attachment.
